# EvilCook

Proto of automated CRUD.

workhorses:
-async js
-php filesystem

short desc:

simple dom reads for collection of editable elements followed by a yield of modified components ( well, whole app ) that automagically structures the app after the generated JSON..

A lot of work followed by a ton of if and maybes .. but theoretically possible.

personal note:
-deadline 3 days, else hardcode editable elements.
